### TITLE: Second day of March 2021 (2/05/2021)
My love story begins where every love story starts from, I fell in love. Although it’s a bit more complicated than that, it took months, blood, sweat and tears to accomplish it, but if you ask me presently if it’s worth it, I’d answer with these words;
“She the reason I live, if living was falling in love with her every day, then I live every day. She the reason I never want to stop having. Her relishing beauty alone makes my sun rise, my heart skip beats and my smile splendid. I found perfection, love, glamour, pleasure, inspiration, an hidden treasure, a mended soul and a melted heart and love, all in her, to top it all up, she’s my greatest strength, my greatest weakness, the reason I go crazy, like crazy in love. She the only reason I love, funny enough I have no idea why I love her this much, but it’s a great feeling. I believe it was William Wordsworth who defined poetry as the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions recollected in tranquility. She my poetry, and every minute I spend with her makes me speechless, every poem I write for her make my weak, cause I’m usually exhausted from the constant racking of my brain trying to find words to describe her and I don’t mean funny, smart, beauty or those flattering non sense anyone can coin, I mean words that will make even nature jealous. Just so you know, if you looking for beauty in person, I’ve seen her, she’s the queen of my heart, my inspiration, my perfect princess and God’s personal angel sent to safe me, and shape my heart to love, comparing her to nature would be a grave offence, nature worships her beauty, her perfection, her royalty, she’s just too good to be true”. 
Now tell me if she’s not worth every heart break I ever felt, every blood I shed, every pain I ever knew and every time I waited?

##### If words were enough to express how sorry I am, it would be every word and Language on earth trying to comprehend it, If my apologies were enough to make me feel better, it would take eternity for me to apologize and If my aim of perfection would be met, it would take you, my perfection to be in my Life forever,  I am only Perfect for you, and without you I am really nothing.

##### I pray I will be good enough for you, every time I almost get close to being that, I screw it up with jealousy and it hurt me. I hope your perfection pardons my mistake and make my efforts to be good enough for you worth it. I sincerely do Love You more than I can comprehend, even more than I can feel, even more then you know, and every pain I put you through puts me through hell, I hurt my world and there is no excuse for my stupid act, I just hope you will alway forgive me

##### On an ending note, I've made so many mistakes, so many wrong choices, but you the one best choice that corrects every mistake I ever made, you make every mistake, every wrong step worth it, and if Loving You was a mistake then it's the best mistake I've ever made, it's so good, it feels like a perfect choice. My World, this is my apology, This is my plea and assurance to do better.
